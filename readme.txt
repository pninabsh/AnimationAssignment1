Final Project: 


So first of all, We've added all the required tasks to the projects. 
Bonus tasks - Texture to the snake, Colorful Prize Ball, Dancing Balls, and Sounds. We've also tried to add ImGui but it didn't work.

We would like to add that we've worked very hard to add a meaningful UI to the game with the ImGUI library, it took us about 7 human days to finally give up and leave it.
We would like to state that the main problem was an inner problem with the project architecture and not something that related to our skills in integrating with external libraries.

It was also very difficult to create the 2 views, and it created a large amount of regressions bugs on features that already been working(like finishing level and clearing the board)
and it was very difficult to figure out what went wrong.
